# YOLO-Pose
A deep learning framework for target detection based on and improved upon YOLOv2. This YOLO-like CNN will  flexibly output the boundaries of targets of any shape, instead of just rectangular bounding boxes parallel to the length and width of the image


The CNN network architecture is as below.
